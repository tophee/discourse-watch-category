discourse-watch-category
========================

A simple plugin that watches a category or sub-category for all the users in the system or all the users in a particular group.

Configure by editing `plugin.rb`.

To prevent conflicts with my changes, you should fork your own copy of this repository and then follow the typical [installation steps](https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-a-plugin/19157).

The plugin runs every six hours. You can trigger it manually at http://www.example.com/sidekiq/scheduler

Note that the purpose of this fork is merely to customize the categories and groups. It has not been developed or improved. So if you want to use it, you should rather fork its parent.
